  <li>Pay with Stripe</li>

  <li>Admin page to change teams and # of rounds later</li>
  <li>Chat stays open until Sept. 5, archives up indefinitely</li>
  <h6>Is it secure?</h6>
  It's not HTTPS, but I have done my best to avoid saving or even touching personal information like credit card #, See the <a href="/faq">FAQ</a> for a more detailed explanation. 
  <h6>Can I trust you with these emails?</h6>
  <p>I won't spam you or sell your emails.  I'll send emails to owners when the league starts or when you ask me to.</p>
  <h6>What's the pitch?</h6>
  <p>  This lets you take your time with your draft party, and enter results to your league site later.  It works for real-life situations.  
  One guy might have to entertain his 3-year old and make his picks from home on his computer.  
  You might have a league of 12 players you knew in college, but 5 of them moved away when they graduated.</p>
  <h6>Any downsides?</h6>
  <p> I don't have a player list and player chooser yet, so you have to type the player names to put them on the draft board.  In the future, I should be able to provide this along with the ability for the owners to make their picks.</p>
